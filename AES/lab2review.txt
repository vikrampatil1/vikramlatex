Correctness:

- The program has a runtime error:
$ java driver < testcase.txt
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string:
""
  at
java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:65)
  at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:504)
  at AESKeyGenerator.generateRoundKeys(AESKeyGenerator.java:94)
  at Driver.main(Driver.java:13)


Style:

- Both files have major style problems. You are not following the style
  guidelines.

- Incorrect indentation in both the driver and aescipher files. Please use a
  two-space indentation.

- Poor block comments

- The header in both files is incorrectly formatted. It should be like
  this:
/**
 * file: SinglyLinkedList.java
 * author: student name
 * course: CMPT 220
 * assignment: project 1
 * due date: August 30, 2003
 * version: 1.3
 *
 * This file contains the declaration of the SinglyLinkedList abstract data
 * type.
 */

- Both files have incorrect method header formatting. Each function must have a
  comment block before it, which gives the function name, describes each
  parameter and the return value (if any), and explains the purpose of the
  function. Refer to the parameters by name, not by type. Here is an example:
/**
 * factorial
 *
 * This function computes the factorial of the given input. The factorial is
 * defined as factorial(n) = n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   n: the number on which to compute the factorial
 * 
 * Return value: the factorial of n, or 1 if n <= 0.
 */
public static int factorial(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}


Efficiency and Other Comments:

- When searching the Sbox or Rcon you are constantly parsing integers. Perhaps
  it would be more efficient to have them as integers already and save
  constantly parsing.

- The driver.java file is incorrecly named as: Driver.java

- The aescipher.java file is incorrectly named as: AESKeyGenerator.java
