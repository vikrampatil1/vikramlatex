Summary:

- The summary has poor quality. 17% of what you wrote comes exactly from the
  article, and that is not good. You can see your report on iLearn/Turnitin.


\LaTeX:

- When using tables, try to keep the \hline inline with the \\ to save row
  space.

- When writing \LaTeX, try to keep every line of text within 80 characters or
  100 at the most, then continue in a new line, \LaTeX will continue if you
  break lines.

- The usage of tables is incomplete. Usually tables have a caption that
  describes the content of the table.
